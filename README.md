I am trying to make my own game engine in cpp using DirectX11. I am far from done rn. Currently you can move around in a 3D scene, add and remove cubes, spheres and pyramids and play with their properties(psoition, auto-rotate, and add a phong-shader). You can save and load scenes as well.

Controls: 

    wasd -> move
    rmb(hold) -> look around
    space -> move up
    ctrl -> move down
