I am trying to make my own game engine in cpp using DirectX11. I am far from done rn. Currently you can move around in a 3D scene, add and remove cubes, spheres and pyramids and play with their properties(psoition, auto-rotate, and add a phong-shader). You can save and load scenes as well. 

Controls: 

    wasd -> move
    rmb(hold) -> look around
    space -> move up
    ctrl -> move down

I highly recommend that you use the [compiler I am using](https://github.com/brechtsanders/winlibs_mingw/releases/download/14.2.0posix-19.1.1-12.0.0-ucrt-r2/winlibs-x86_64-posix-seh-gcc-14.2.0-llvm-19.1.1-mingw-w64ucrt-12.0.0-r2.zip).
